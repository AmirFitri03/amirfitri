        <p> The student record GUI is a graphical user interface that allows 
            users to manage and view student records. The GUI has three input 
            fields: name, matrix number, and faculty name. Users can enter the 
            information of a student and click the save button to store the 
            record in a file. Users can also delete a record by selecting it 
            \from a list and clicking the delete button. Users can load a record 
            from a file by clicking the load button and choosing the file name. 
            The GUI also has two sorting options: by name or by faculty name. 
            Users can sort the records in ascending or descending order by clicking 
            the corresponding buttons. The GUI displays the sorted records in a table 
            with columns for name, matrix number, and faculty name. The GUI is designed
            to help users organize and access student records easily and efficiently.</p>
